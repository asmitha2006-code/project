#Daily Study Planner
####Video Demo:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhiGV8tjRJ8
####Description:

A command-line based **Daily Study Planner** built using Python that helps users **organize tasks**, **set priorities**, **track completion**, and **monitor daily progress**. All data is stored locally using a **JSON** file, making the application lightweight and easy to use.

It also includes a **test** file (test_project.py) that uses Python’s assert statements to validate the correctness of core functions.

####This planner allows users to:
**Add daily tasks** that adds tasks
**Set task priorities**(high,low,medium) based on user's intrest
**Mark tasks as completed**
**Delete tasks** that are not necessary
**Track daily progress**
Persistent data storage using JSON

####Technologies/tools used:

-Python 3
-JSON for data storage
-datetime module
-Pytest for testing

####Project Structure:

-project.py(Main program file containing all functionality.)
-study_planner.json(Stores tasks and completion data (auto-generated).)
-README.md(Description file (this one).)
-test_project.py(Contains test cases for validation.)
